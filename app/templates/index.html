            <h2>What is a Carbon Footprint?</h2>
            <p>Carbon footprint refers to the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases emitted directly or indirectly by an individual, organization, or activity. 
            These emissions are major contributors to climate change, trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere and leading to global warming. Reducing our carbon footprint is crucial for mitigating 
            climate impacts and fostering a healthier environment.</p>

            reduce their carbon footprints.</p>
